    On Monday the 13th in July, a Rec Center was proposed to townhall and was accepted. Contruction began on the 25th of July and was done efficiently. An open field north of the town was the proposed location of where the building would be. By august 9th the frame was finished, and the walls were already being built.

    The building's exterior was completed on the 21st and the interior had begun construction the very next day. Unfortunately, the interiors construction had to stop because of supply issues, and didnâ€™t start up again until the 31st which at that point the deadline was very close.

    Finally, the Rec Center was completed on the 3rd of September and was opened on the 10th. The Rec Center had 3 basketball courts, a library, 23 office rooms, 5 group activity rooms, and a field outside for football and soccer. The community has already shown their love for the Center. Local adolescent Mathew Luis described <q>  I love the basketball court; my friends and I always go there and play for hours </q>. The completion of the Rec Center has helped this town even more in providing for the community.
